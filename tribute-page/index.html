        <h2><strong>Here's a time line of Job's life:</strong></h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 24, 1955</strong> - Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco</li>

                <li><strong>1961</strong> - The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon Valley.</li>

                <li><strong>1968</strong> - Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency
                counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.</li>

                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the
                two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.</li>

                <li><strong>1972</strong> - Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Ore., only to drop
                out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite not
                getting credit for them.</li>

                <li><strong>1974</strong> - Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the
                hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs
                leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.</li>

                <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a
                kit that sells for $666.66.</li>

                <li><strong>January 3, 1977</strong> - Apple incorporates.</li>

                <li><strong>June 5, 1977</strong> - Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a plastic case with color graphics--and
                Apple's first successful personal computer.</li>

                <li><strong>December 12, 1980</strong> - Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.</li>

                <li><strong>January 24, 1984</strong> - Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to
                much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself."
                The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially
                successful small computer with a graphical user interface.</li>

                <li><strong>1985</strong> - CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've
                been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life. It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30
                years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70
                million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim
                Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.</li>

                <li><strong>1986</strong> - For $10 million, buys the Graphics Group division of Lucasfilm that becomes Pixar Animation Studios.</li>

                <li><strong>1988</strong> - NeXT Computer releases its first computer.</li>

                <li><strong>1993</strong> - NeXT discontinues hardware business, gets into software instead. The company is renamed NeXT Software, Inc.</li>

                <li><strong>1995</strong> - Becomes Pixar's president and CEO. Later in the year, Jobs brings Pixar public, one week after the release of "Toy
                Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The film earns $192 million at the box
                office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters.</li>

                <li><strong>1996</strong> - Returns to Apple, as an adviser, after it buys NeXT for $429 million.</li>

                <li><strong>1997</strong> - Becomes CEO, initially as the de facto chief, then as interim chief in September.</li>

                it counted 225 million iTunes accounts with credit cards as of June 2011.</li>
